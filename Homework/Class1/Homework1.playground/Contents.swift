//  1) Read and complete chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 from the Ray Wenderlich pdf found in our course repo





//  2)

//  i) Create a new app project, Single view, and call it 'Homework1_[initials]'. In the main view of the app, I want you to add the following: 3 UILabels and 4 UIButtons. Use autolayout to configure the view to look like the design provided (firstIteration.png).

//  ii) Then in code, I want you to create a data model as a value type that will represent a vehicle with the following properties:

//  maker: String
//  model: String
//  cost: Double

//  iii) Then when the main view controller loads, instantiate 4 instances of the vehicle data model (with any custom data you'd like, though model it after a real life example), and all the buttons with a corresponding maker string as the button title.

//  iv) When each button is pressed, the view should update so that the labels show the maker, model, and cost

//  v) The padding around each of the buttons should be 20px.

//  vi) Add a UIImageView to the right hand side of the labels (following the design file called secondIteration.png). Add a property of type URL that represents the imageURL in the data model. Find the corresponding image URL for each maker and make sure to add them to the correesponding data model when instantiating them. Then when a button is tapped, fill the image using the imageURL property. When the app first launches, set the background color of the UIImageView to gray.
